Final project

Due Date: Start of scheduled final exam slot
THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL PROJECT.

Option 1 -- standard credit for 472 students
One of the goals of this course is that you be able to apply what you learn about machine organization to unfamiliar machines. In this paper, you'll choose a computer architecture and compare and contrast that architecture to either ARM or IA.
Main point and purpose: This is an opportunity for you to apply what you've learned in class to a new situation. This is the best way to solidify your knowledge!
Contents and form: The paper must be as long as it needs to be, single-spaced, 10 point (appropriate) font. It should use correct grammar and spelling. You must not plagiarize material. You must cite any sources, and include a bibliography. Extra credit will be given if write-up is created in LaTeX (or variant)
In the paper, you should include the following topics. REMEMBER YOUR AUDIENCE as you write and compare the architecture to what you know of ARM.
Introduction to the architecture including history
Instruction set design (is it RISC/CISC, what addressing modes are offered, how long are addresses, what's the minimum addressable unit in memory, etc.)
Datapath design (how many registers, is it single-cycle, multi-cycle, pipelined, is microcode used, etc.)
Memory subsystem (what are the memory limits, are there caches, how is virtual memory supported by the hardware, etc)
Other HPC focused characteristics in this system
An explanation of how the features of this system might boost performance.
In some of the above, you will likely be talking about specific implementations of the architecture. It is sufficient to focus on one implementation.
Example Topic Choices:
AMD Hammer
VAX
A historical machine such as ENIAC, EDSAC, IBM System/360, UNIVAC, CDC 6600, Intel 4004, Intel 8008, Intel 8080
PowerPC
SPARC
HP PA-RISC
DEC Alpha
Parallel machines such a SGI Origin, IBM RS/6000 SP, Cray X-MP/416
